		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<div class="intro">
			<img src="images/meinapic.png" alt="Dallas smiling at camera wearing glasses">
			<p>I found interest in web development when I was just a teenager, but I have only just begun my road to making a life out of it. 
			I will graduate in 2021 with an associate degree in computer science and I plan to continue my education even further after that. 
			So far, I have learned the basics in becoming a great web developer. I still have a long way to go but have the determination to 
			see it through. Computer technologies have always been my passion!</p>
			
			<p>Because of my schooling and how much I have learned, I am already gaining opportunities for work. The ability to expand my knowledge as well 
			as my portfolio is a wonderful thing. With hard work and determination, I will achieve my goals. Anyone who hires me for their web development 
			needs will not regret their decision. </p>

			<p>With passion from a young age, I want to contribute to projects that help clients achieve their goals. I am available for taking on new work. 
			My skills and specialties include web development, web design, database management, photography, vlogging, and Getting Things Done. 
			This site showcases various projects created throughout this semester.</p>
